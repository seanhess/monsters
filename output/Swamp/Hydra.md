*A bit like a dragon, wingless though it may be. Heads, nine in number at birth, spring from a muscled trunk and weave a sinuous pattern in the air. A hydra is to be fearedâ€”a scaled terror of the marsh. The older ones, though, they have more heads, for every failed attempt to murder it just makes it stronger. Cut off a head and two more grow in its place. Only a strike, true and strong, to the heart can end a hydraâ€™s life. Not time or tide or any other thing but this.*

>Attack many enemies at once

>Regenerate a body part (especially a head)
