*Some are wont to lump these little, rat-like dragon-men in with goblins and orcs, bugbears and hobgoblins. They are smarter and wiser than their kin, however. The kobolds are beholden slaves to dragons and were, in ancient times, their lorekeepers and sorcerer-servants. Their clans, with  names like Ironscale and Whitewing, form around a dragon master and live to serve and do its bidding. Spotting a kobold means more are nearâ€”and if more are near then a mighty dragon cannot be far, either.*
