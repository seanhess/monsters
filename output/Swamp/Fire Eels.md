*These strange creatures are no bigger or smarter than their mundane kin. They have the same vicious nature. Over their relations they have one advantageâ€”an oily secretion that oozes from their skin. It makes them hard to catch. On top of that, with a twist of their body they can ignite the stuff, leaving pools of burning oil atop the surface of the water and roasting prey and predator alike. I hear the slimy things make good ingredients for fire-resistant gear, but you have to get your hands on one, first.*
