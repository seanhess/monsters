*Not every attack by orcs is torches and screaming and enslavement. Among those who follow He of Riven Sight, poison and murder-in-the-dark are considered sacred arts. Enter the shadowhunter. Orcs cloaked in Nightâ€™s magic who slip into camps, towns and temples and end the lives of those within. Do not be so distracted by the howling of the berserkers that you donâ€™t notice the knife at your back.*
